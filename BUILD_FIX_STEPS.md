# 🔧 Build Error Fix - Duplicate Class Issue

## ✅ What I Fixed

Added packaging options to `app/build.gradle.kts` to handle duplicate resources.

## 📋 Steps to Fix the Build

### Option 1: Clean Build (Recommended - Try First)

**In Android Studio:**
1. Go to **Build** → **Clean Project**
2. Wait for it to finish
3. Then **Build** → **Rebuild Project**

**From Terminal/Command Line:**
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "C:\Users\swapn\AndroidStudioProjects\mobileAppDemo"

# Clean build
./gradlew clean

# Rebuild
./gradlew build
```

**OR on Windows:**
```cmd
cd C:\Users\swapn\AndroidStudioProjects\mobileAppDemo
gradlew.bat clean
gradlew.bat build
```

---

### Option 2: Invalidate Caches (If Clean Build Doesn't Work)

**In Android Studio:**
1. Go to **File** → **Invalidate Caches...**
2. Check **✓ Clear file system cache and Local History**
3. Check **✓ Clear downloaded shared indexes**
4. Click **Invalidate and Restart**
5. After restart, **Build** → **Rebuild Project**

---

### Option 3: Delete Build Directories (Nuclear Option)

**If above steps don't work:**

```bash
# Delete all build directories
rm -rf app/build
rm -rf build
rm -rf .gradle

# Then in Android Studio:
# File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
# Build → Rebuild Project
```

**On Windows:**
```cmd
rmdir /s /q app\build
rmdir /s /q build
rmdir /s /q .gradle
```

## 🔍 What Caused This?

The error `Type androidx.coordinatorlayout.R$attr is defined multiple times` happens because:

1. **Duplicate Dependency**: `coordinatorlayout` is explicitly included in your dependencies
2. **Transitive Inclusion**: It's also included automatically by Material library
3. **Build Cache**: Old build artifacts conflicting with new ones

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed in build.gradle.kts

Added this section to handle duplicate resources:

```kotlin
packaging {
    resources {
        excludes += "/META-INF/{AL2.0,LGPL2.1}"
        excludes += "META-INF/androidx.*.version"
    }
}
```

---

## 🎯 Additional Fix (Optional)

If the problem persists, you can remove the explicit coordinatorlayout dependency since Material library already includes it:

**In `app/build.gradle.kts`, remove this line:**
```kotlin
implementation("androidx.coordinatorlayout:coordinatorlayout:1.2.0")  // Remove this
```

Material library (`com.google.android.material:material:1.11.0`) already includes coordinatorlayout as a transitive dependency.

---

## ✅ Expected Result

After cleaning and rebuilding, you should see:
```
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in Xs
```

---

## 🚨 If Still Failing

If you still get errors after all above steps:

1. **Check Gradle Version**: Make sure you're using a compatible Gradle version
2. **Update Dependencies**: Some dependencies might need updating
3. **Check for Other Duplicates**: Run:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew app:dependencies
   ```
   This shows all dependencies and can reveal conflicts

## 📞 Quick Fix Commands (Copy-Paste)

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
cd C:\Users\swapn\AndroidStudioProjects\mobileAppDemo
gradlew.bat clean
gradlew.bat build
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\swapn\AndroidStudioProjects\mobileAppDemo
.\gradlew.bat clean
.\gradlew.bat build
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cd ~/path/to/mobileAppDemo
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build
```

## ✅ After Successful Build

Your quick wins will work:
- ✅ Realistic buffer system
- ✅ Visual confidence indicators
- ✅ Quick actions helper
- ✅ 4-week capacity planning
