## 💡 How System Guides Users

### 1. **At-a-Glance Status** (Home Screen)
When user opens the app, they immediately see:
```
🟢 Workload Status                    45%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
You have good capacity available

12.0h                    +3
Workload              More Orders
```

**Tells user**: 
- Current capacity (45%)
- Status (Available - safe to accept orders)
- Workload (12 hours of work pending)
- Capacity (+3 more orders can be accepted)

### 2. **Proactive Alerts** (Home Screen)
Users see urgent deliveries without searching:
```
⏰ Upcoming Deliveries

🔴 DUE TODAY: John Doe - Order #00123
🟠 DUE TOMORROW: Jane Smith - Order #00125
🔵 Due in 5 days: Bob Johnson - Order #00127

[View All Orders]
```

**Guides user to**:
- Prioritize urgent orders
- Contact customers proactively
- Plan ahead for deliveries
- Take immediate action on overdue items

### 3. **Decision Support** (Order Creation)
When creating a new order:
```
Toast: "⚠️ WARNING: You're currently overbooked at 95% capacity!"
```

**Helps user**:
- Avoid overbooking
- Set realistic delivery dates
- Manage customer expectations
- Make informed commitments

### 4. **Interactive Navigation**
Users can:
- Tap any delivery alert → View full order details
- Click "View All Orders" → Go to orders list
- See real-time updates as orders are completed
- Get immediate feedback on capacity changes

## 🎯 User Journey Example

### Scenario: Monday Morning

**User opens app:**
1. Sees greeting: "Good Morning! Let's start the day with productivity!"
2. Sees workload status: "🟡 75% capacity - You're running at high capacity"
3. Sees delivery alert: "🔴 DUE TODAY: Sarah Williams - Order #00134"

**User taps the alert:**
- Navigates to Order #00134 details
- Reviews order information
- Marks order as "In Progress"

**User goes back to home:**
- Workload refreshes automatically
- Shows updated capacity: "70% capacity"
- Alert disappears (marked in progress)
- New alert visible: "🟠 DUE TOMORROW: Mike Brown - Order #00135"

**User decides to create new order:**
- Navigates to Create Order
- System shows: "⚠️ You're running at high capacity (70%)"
- Auto-calculates delivery date: "Estimated delivery in 14 days"
- User can proceed with awareness of current load
