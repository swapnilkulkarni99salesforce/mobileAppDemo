This document describes the enhanced workload management features that provide real-time guidance on capacity, upcoming deliveries, and workload analytics.

## ✨ Implemented Features

### 1. **Workload Status Dashboard** ⭐ NEW
A visual dashboard card on the Home screen that displays:

#### Features:
- **Capacity Utilization Percentage**: Visual progress bar showing 0-100% capacity
- **Status Indicator**: Color-coded emoji system
  - 🟢 **Green** (AVAILABLE): < 70% capacity

  - 🔴 **Red** (OVERBOOKED): > 90% capacity
- **Workload Hours**: Total hours of pending work
- **Recommended Capacity**: Number of additional orders you can accept

```

### 3. **Capacity Warnings in Order Creation** ⭐ NEW

  ```
  
- **High Capacity Alert** (70-90%):
  ```
  ⚠️ You're running at high capacity (85%)
  ```

- **Good Capacity Message** (<70%):
  ```
  ✅ You have good capacity available
  ```

#### Benefits:
- Prevents overbooking
- Sets realistic customer expectations
- Helps manage workload proactively

### 4. **WorkloadHelper Utility Class** 🛠️
Centralized utility for all workload calculations and analytics.

#### Key Methods:

**calculateWorkloadStatus()**
```kotlin
fun calculateWorkloadStatus(
    pendingOrders: List<Order>,
    config: WorkloadConfig
): WorkloadStatus
```
Returns comprehensive workload status including:
- Utilization percentage
- Total pending orders
- Total hours needed
- Available hours this week
- Days until next available slot
- Status level (AVAILABLE/BUSY/OVERBOOKED)
- Recommendation message
- Remaining capacity

**getDeliveryAlerts()**
```kotlin
fun getDeliveryAlerts(orders: List<Order>): List<DeliveryAlert>
```
Returns sorted list of delivery alerts with:
- Order details
- Days until delivery
- Overdue status
- Alert level (URGENT/WARNING/UPCOMING)

**calculateDeliveryDate()**
```kotlin
fun calculateDeliveryDate(
    pendingOrdersCount: Int,
    config: WorkloadConfig,
    startDate: Calendar = Calendar.getInstance()
): Calendar
```
Calculates optimal delivery date considering:
- Current pending orders
- Time per order from config
- Weekly working hours schedule

## 📊 Workload Status Calculation Logic

### Capacity Utilization Formula:
```
Utilization % = (Total Hours Needed / Available Hours This Week) × 100

Where:
- Total Hours Needed = Pending Orders × Time Per Order
- Available Hours = Sum of remaining working hours in current week
```

### Status Level Thresholds:
- **AVAILABLE**: 0-69% utilization
- **BUSY**: 70-89% utilization  
- **OVERBOOKED**: 90%+ utilization

### Recommended Capacity:
```
Recommended Orders = (Available Hours - Current Workload) / Time Per Order
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Color Scheme:

**Workload Status Card**:
- Background: `#FFF3E0` (Warm amber)
- Text: `#E65100` (Deep orange)
- Progress bars:
  - Green: Available capacity
  - Orange: Busy
  - Red: Overbooked

**Delivery Alerts Card**:
- Background: `#FFEBEE` (Light red)
- Text: `#C62828` (Dark red)
- Alert colors:
  - Red: Urgent/Overdue
  - Orange: Warning
  - Blue: Upcoming

### Card Visibility Logic:
Both cards use intelligent visibility:
- **Hidden by default** (android:visibility="gone")
- **Shown only when relevant**:
  - Workload card: When pending orders exist
  - Alerts card: When deliveries are due within 7 days
- **Auto-refresh** on returning to Home screen
