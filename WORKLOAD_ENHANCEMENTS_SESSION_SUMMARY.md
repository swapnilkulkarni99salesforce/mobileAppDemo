val impact = QuickActionsHelper.calculateExtraHoursImpact(
    extraHours = 3f,
    config = config,
    pendingOrdersCount = 10
)
println(impact.additionalCapacity) // See how many more orders you can take

// 3. View 4-week capacity
val weeklyData = WorkloadHelper.calculateMultiWeekCapacity(orders, config)
val summary = WorkloadHelper.formatWeeklySummary(weeklyData)
println(summary) // See your capacity outlook
```
