- Total workload in hours
- Number of additional orders that can be accepted
- Color-changing progress bar

**Intelligence**:
- Only visible when there are pending orders

### Delivery Alerts Widget

**Location**: Home Fragment (below workload status)

**Shows**:
- Up to 5 most urgent deliveries
- Color-coded by urgency (Red/Orange/Blue)
- Formatted alert messages with customer names
- "View All Orders" button

**Interactivity**:
- Tap any alert → Navigate to order details
- Tap "View All Orders" → Go to orders list
- Auto-refreshes with latest data

### Capacity Warnings

**Location**: Create Order Fragment (on load)

**Triggers**:
- Overbooked (>90%): Shows warning toast
- Busy (70-90%): Shows caution toast
- Available (<70%): Shows positive message

**Benefits**:
- Prevents overbooking
- Sets user expectations
- Encourages realistic planning

## 🎯 User Value Proposition

### Problem Solved:
**Before**: 
- Users had no visibility into current workload
- Risk of overbooking and missed deadlines
- Manual calculation of delivery dates
- No warning system for capacity issues

**After**:
- ✅ Clear visual representation of capacity
- ✅ Proactive warnings prevent overbooking
- ✅ Automatic delivery date calculation
- ✅ Priority alerts for upcoming deliveries
- ✅ Data-driven decision making

### Key Metrics Users Can Track:
1. Current capacity utilization %
2. Total pending workload hours
3. Number of orders that can be accepted
4. Upcoming deliveries by priority
5. Days until next available slot

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Data Flow:
```

    ↓
loadWorkloadStatus()
    ├── Query WorkloadConfig
    ├── Query pending Orders
    ├── Calculate with WorkloadHelper
    └── Update UI
    ↓
loadDeliveryAlerts()
    ├── Query pending Orders
    ├── Calculate urgency
    ├── Sort by priority

```

## 📈 Capacity Calculation Algorithm

### Utilization Formula:
```kotlin
val totalHoursNeeded = pendingOrders.size * config.timePerOrderHours
val availableHoursThisWeek = calculateRemainingWeeklyHours(config)
val utilizationPercentage = (totalHoursNeeded / availableHoursThisWeek) * 100
```

### Status Determination:
```kotlin
when {
    utilization < 70  -> StatusLevel.AVAILABLE  // 🟢
    utilization < 90  -> StatusLevel.BUSY       // 🟡
    utilization >= 90 -> StatusLevel.OVERBOOKED // 🔴
}
```

### Recommended Capacity:
```kotlin
val remainingCapacity = availableHoursThisWeek - totalHoursNeeded
val recommendedOrders = max(0, remainingCapacity / config.timePerOrderHours)
```

## 🎨 Design Patterns Used

1. **Observer Pattern**: Auto-refresh on data changes
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different alert levels with different behaviors
3. **Singleton Pattern**: WorkloadHelper as utility object
4. **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic creation of alert views
5. **Repository Pattern**: Database access through DAOs

## 📱 User Interface Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy:
1. Most urgent information first (alerts)
2. High-level status (workload percentage)
3. Detailed metrics (hours, capacity)
4. Actions (view all orders)

### Color Psychology:
- **Red**: Urgent, needs immediate attention
- **Orange**: Warning, plan ahead
- **Green**: Positive, safe to proceed
- **Blue**: Informational, upcoming

### Progressive Disclosure:
- Cards hidden when not relevant
- Top 5 alerts shown, rest accessible via button
- Summary on home, details on tap
